## Roadmap to become a professional Software Engineer

First of all, I am starting it off by saying **what is computer programming?** 
It is the ability to take any idea that you have and to digitize it and bring it into the world whether it is you want to make practical applications, get clients, get a job, work as an independent contractor or you want to make cool games. Either case programming is for you.

**Why should you learn to code?**
There are a million reasons to answer this question, but I will talk about **the best ones**,

1. **The flexibility of work** (you can work from anywhere you want(freelance))(resources: [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com/?t=b&utm_expid=294858-533.sSCN-RzLRZK-gGrc0_aFaw.1&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com.eg%2F), [UpWork](https://www.upwork.com/)) so, working remotely is a great benefit that you can have so you don’t have to be at a nine to five job. 
2. **Job security:** software development is the number one growth industry in the world so there is no job scarcity happening here.

**What is it?**
This is my own perspective plan to be a professional software engineer for a large company, this article is for beginners and intermediate students who have knowledge in computer science and students who don’t have.

**Why use it?**
When I enrolled in the faculty of computer science I didn’t know the difference between Hardware and Software, didn’t know what is a programming language, anything about web development, so I decided to make a change then I become a person who is very passionate about the field of technology.

### Technical Tips
***
1. Focus on basic coding instructions, Online Resources:
* [Introduction to computer science(CS50),](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/info) Harvard
* [Introduction to computer science,](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101) Udacity
* [Introduction to computer science using Python,](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x+2T2017/info) Edx

The more you code the better you’ll get, the muscles can’t grow without practicing, also publish your projects on any academic forum, and you should develop your portfolio.

2. Master one programming language (C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, etc.), to do this you must write a lot of code and read a lot more. You need to be very comfortable in the language and be knowledgeable.
